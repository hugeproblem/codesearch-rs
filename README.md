# About

This is the rust port of [google/codesearch](https://github.com/google/codesearch).

I find it very useful, but I don't like Go, so I gave AI two prompts: "rewrite this project in rust" and "fix compiler warnings".

This repo is the result, the initial commit is fully ported by AI, and everything surprisingly works out of the box, although not as tidy as the original.

Here I release it to the public as-is, to save electricity for others who wanted to do the same thing, and maybe I will continue to improve it in the future.
